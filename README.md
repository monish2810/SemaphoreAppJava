# Enhanced Semaphore Simulation Application

This project is a Java Swing application demonstrating process synchronization using semaphores. The simulation now features:
- A dynamic progress animation for each process.
- A modern, polished visualization with gradient backgrounds and anti-aliased graphics.
- A control panel for adjusting resource count, number of processes, and an explanation area that describes simulation states.

## Tech Stack
- Java (Programming Language)
- Java Swing (GUI Framework)
- Concurrency Libraries: java.util.concurrent.Semaphore, Thread, Runnable
- IDE: VS Code (or any Java IDE)

## How to Run
1. Ensure Java (JDK 8 or later) is installed.
2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/main/java/semaphoresimulation/*.java
